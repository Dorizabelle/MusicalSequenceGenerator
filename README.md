# MusicalSequenceGenerator
Senior Research 

Developed a Python Musical Sequence Generator based on a graph structure, inspired by Leonhard Euler's Speculum Musicum mathematical approach. 
The musical sequence generator allows users to specify starting notes and sequence lengths, facilitating 
exploration of different tonalities and experimentation. Generates MIDI files for easy transfer to various music 
production software platforms.
Implemented an intuitive interface and guidelines to ensure accessibility for users with varying levels of music composition experience.
